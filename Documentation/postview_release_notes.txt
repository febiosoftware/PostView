Version 2.1 - 11/20/2017
========================

- A new, user-defined data field can now be defined via a mathematical expression. Select Add\Equation... from the 
data panel to access the corresponding dialog box. Currently, only scalar expressions are supported and the variables 
x, y, z for nodal position, and t for time are recognized.

- Mathematical expressions can now be overlayed on the Graph window. Press the "Tools" button on a Graph
window and then click the "Math plot" option of the tools panel to enter the expression. In the edit field a scalar
expression with the variable x as the ordinate can be entered. Press Plot to show the expression on the Graph. 

- A new "Area coverage" tool was added, which calculates the coverage of two surfaces. It can be found on the Tools panel.
It assigns a value of 1 or zero of each node of a surface depending on whether it is covered by a second surface. 
The total covered area can then be calculated using the Integration tool. 

- A bug that prevented node and element data from being displayed correctly in the Integration window was fixed. 

- A bug was fixed in the arithmetic data filter for element data fields. 

- A shortcut 'U' was added for unhiding all hidden mesh items. 

- A bug was fixed in the distance map tools for triangle surfaces. 

- The data field selector was redesigned and uses a selection menu (like in PostView 1.x)

- The show and enable buttons on the Material Panel are replaced with icons (like it was in PostView 1.x). 

- A gradient filter was added that calculates the gradient of a scalar field. To use it, select a scalar data field in the 
Data panel, click the "Filter..." button, and select Gradient from the "Filter" list in the corresponding dialog box. 

- The dialog box for exporting .k files was added back. This dialog box allows users to customize what will be output to
the .k file. 

- An minor issue with the Kinemat tool was fixed that always showed the second step, instead of the first, by default. 

- The direction of the light can now be set from the Settings window. Select the View/Settings.. menu and then click the Lighting tab.

- A bug in the VTK import was fixed. 

- A recent file list was added to the File menu. A maximum of 15 recently accessed files will be displayed in this menu for easy access. 

- An icon that displays the color of each material was added the material list on the Material panel. 

- Added colormap options for iso-surface, slice, and vector plots. 

- A reset button was added to the Settings window that restores all the display settings back to their default values.
