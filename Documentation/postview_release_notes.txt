========================================================================


Version 2.3.2 - 11/9/2018
==========================

- Fixed issue with arithmetic data filter


Version 2.3.1 - 11/2/2018
==========================

- Fixed some issues with VTK export and added option to choose between exporting all states and just the current one. Added ability to import face data from file. 

- Fixed minor issue with distance map tool.

- Volume for tet10, tet15, and tet20 elements are now calculated. 

- Option was added to change reference state in strain field evaluations in data panel.

- Link to online help was fixed.


Version 2.3 - 7/3/2018
========================

- New plotting features for visualizing fluid problems: stream line plot, particle flow.

- New tensor plot visualization tool was added. This tool allows the visualization of (second order, symmetric) tensor fields. The tools displays the eigenvectors. Different glyphs can be chosen. 

- PostView 2.3 supports a "dark" theme. To activate it, go to the View\Settings menu. In the Settings dialog box, activate the background tab and select the Theme option. When you change the theme, PostView must be restarted before the change takes effect.

- VEC3F fields can be added with the equation editor tool. The x,y,z components can be entered separately using a mathematical expression.

- Added tool for quadratic and exponential curve fit to Graph window tool. Users can now set the colors of curve fit and math plots on Graph windows.

- The video recording features, including FFMPG recording, were fixed.

- Non-cached data fields can now be copied. Copies are always cached.

- A new data filter was added that allow components of vector, tensor, and array data fields to be extracted into a new scalar data field.

- An issue was fixed related to rendering contour plots for transparent materials. 

- The displacement map can be removed. 

- An issue with the fixed time stepping option was fixed.

- Some minor issues were addressed related to selection. 

- The VRML export feature was fixed.

- Some issues related to volumetric rendering and image slices were fixed, including the ability to delete them. 

- The plot mix tool was fixed. 


Version 2.2
========================

- Fixed time stepping feature is working again. 

- Some issues with area coverage tool was fixed. This tool now also performs better.

- Fixed issue with Kinemat tool when only a single state is loaded.

- The color map editor was improved, a preview of the resulting color was added.

- Support was added for the new array variable type of xplt file format.

Version 2.1 - 11/20/2017
========================

- A new, user-defined data field can now be defined via a mathematical expression. Select Add\Equation... from the 
data panel to access the corresponding dialog box. Currently, only scalar expressions are supported and the variables 
x, y, z for nodal position, and t for time are recognized.

- Mathematical expressions can now be overlayed on the Graph window. Press the "Tools" button on a Graph
window and then click the "Math plot" option of the tools panel to enter the expression. In the edit field a scalar
expression with the variable x as the ordinate can be entered. Press Plot to show the expression on the Graph. 

- A new "Area coverage" tool was added, which calculates the coverage of two surfaces. It can be found on the Tools panel.
It assigns a value of 1 or zero of each node of a surface depending on whether it is covered by a second surface. 
The total covered area can then be calculated using the Integration tool. 

- A bug that prevented node and element data from being displayed correctly in the Integration window was fixed. 

- A bug was fixed in the arithmetic data filter for element data fields. 

- A shortcut 'U' was added for unhiding all hidden mesh items. 

- A bug was fixed in the distance map tools for triangle surfaces. 

- The data field selector was redesigned and uses a selection menu (like in PostView 1.x)

- The show and enable buttons on the Material Panel are replaced with icons (like it was in PostView 1.x). 

- A gradient filter was added that calculates the gradient of a scalar field. To use it, select a scalar data field in the 
Data panel, click the "Filter..." button, and select Gradient from the "Filter" list in the corresponding dialog box. 

- The dialog box for exporting .k files was added back. This dialog box allows users to customize what will be output to
the .k file. 

- An minor issue with the Kinemat tool was fixed that always showed the second step, instead of the first, by default. 

- The direction of the light can now be set from the Settings window. Select the View/Settings.. menu and then click the Lighting tab.

- A bug in the VTK import was fixed. 

- A recent file list was added to the File menu. A maximum of 15 recently accessed files will be displayed in this menu for easy access. 

- An icon that displays the color of each material was added the material list on the Material panel. 

- Added colormap options for iso-surface, slice, and vector plots. 

- A reset button was added to the Settings window that restores all the display settings back to their default values.
