\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostView is a finite element (FE) post-processing application that is designed
 to view 
\emph on
FEBio
\emph default
 output files.
 It offers many post-processing capabilities, such as generation of surface
 plots, isosurface plots, plane cuts, and many more.
 Further, it offers a user-friendly graphical interface that shows 3D visualizat
ion and animation of finite element models.
 It has a customizable Graphics View and users can take snapshots and make
 recordings.
 In addition to reading FEBio output files, PostView can read several other
 file formats, including LSDYNA keyword and database files, NIKE3D input
 and output files, FEBio input files, VTK files and several other formats.
 It also allows the user to import user defined data, offering a flexible
 tool to accommodate the analysis of results from other FE software programs
 in PostView.

System Recommendations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostView runs on most Windows platforms, MAC OSX, and Linux.
 In order to run PostView, a memory size of at least 512 Mb is recommended.
 Larger models may require more memory.
 A processor speed of at least 1 GHz is also recommended.
 The computer's graphics card must support the OpenGL library, since the
 application makes extensive use of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Command Line Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When starting PostView from the command line, the full syntax for the command
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
filename
\emph default
]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\emph on
filename
\emph default
 is the optional name of a FEBio plot file.
 If a filename is specified, the file will be loaded into the PostView environme
nt when PostView starts.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Model Viewer
\emph default
 shows a hierarchical overview of the contents of the model.
 By default, PostView will assign a 
\emph on
Displacement map
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
Color map
\emph default
 to your model.
 The 
\emph on
Displacement map
\emph default
 defines a map that will deform the model, and the 
\emph on
Color map
\emph default
 will define the color displayed on the model.
 Selecting any item in the 
\emph on
Model Viewer
\emph default
 will display its properties list below the 
\emph on
Model Viewer
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select the 
\emph on
Color map
\emph default
 item in the 
\emph on
Model Viewer
\emph default
.
 In the property list, find the 
\emph on
Data field
\emph default
 member.
 This parameter determines the data field that will be used to color the
 model.
 You can select the data field to display by clicking on the 
\emph on
Data field
\emph default
 member and selecting an item from the drop down list.
 To activate the color map, click the check button next to the name of the
 name field.
 Note that you can also select the data field from the main toolbar as well.
 When you select the data field from the main toolbar you can also press
 the 
\emph on

The Graphics View
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:mylabel1"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The big part of the screen that shows a 3D rendering of your model is called
 the 
\emph on
Graphics View
\emph default
.
 When a file is loaded, PostView will display the model in a standard view
 that shows the entire model.
 The user can change the view using the mouse and the mouse buttons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To rotate the view, hold down the left mouse button while dragging the mouse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To pan the view, (that is, to move it left or right) use the middle mouse
 button while dragging.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To zoom the view in or out press the right button while dragging.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostView also defines six default views, namely: top, bottom, left, right,
 front and back.
 The numeric keys on the keypad can be used to select these views.
 For example, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button selects the front view, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

3
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button the right view and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

7
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 selects the top view.
 The opposite views can be activated by holding down the 
\emph on
ctrl 
\emph default
button when pressing the keypad buttons.
 For example, to activate the bottom view, press ctrl
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

7.
 The left view (ctrl
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

3) and back (ctrl
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

1) can be accessed similarly.
 Note that this only works with the numbers on the keypad.
 The numeric keys at the top of your keyboard do nothing.
 If you have trouble remembering these shortcuts (or if you don't have a
 keypad on your keyboard), you can right-click on the 
\emph on
Graphics View,
\emph default
 which brings up a popup menu from which you can select the default views.
 Alternatively, you can also find these options in the View menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Animating the Model 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:animating"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually the file will contain the results of a finite element analysis that
 may have stored the state of the model for several time steps.
 If that is the case, the 
\emph on
State Controller 
\emph default
will be displayed at the bottom of the window.
 The 
\emph on
State Controller
\emph default
 allows you to select different results by clicking inside the dark grey
 area of the 
\emph on

The Capture Frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When storing graphics, it is important to understand the concept of the
 
\emph on
capture frame
\emph default
.
 The capture frame is the area of the screen that will be captured when
 taking a screen shot or recording an animation.
 The capture frame is not always visible, but can be displayed by selecting
 the 
\emph on
View/Toggle Capture Frame
\emph default
 from the menu.
 The same menu will hide it again.
 The capture frame can be shown by selecting the keypad-`0' shortcut.
 When visible, the capture frame can be moved and resized by selecting one
 of the borders and dragging the mouse button.
 To resize it, you must grab the little triangular area in the lower right
 corner of the capture frame.
 If you wish to specify the location and size more accurately, you can open
 the properties dialog box, by selecting the 
\emph on
Edit/Properties 
\emph default
menu or by double-clicking on one of its borders.
\end_layout

 dialog box appears and the desired filename can be entered or selected.
 Images can be saved as BMP, TIFF or JPEG images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Recording an animation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostView has the capability to record an animation of the current GV.
 To record an animation, first position and resize the capture frame so
 that it covers the desired area of the GV that will be captured.
 Next, select the 
\emph on
Record/New 
\emph default
menu.
 This opens a standard file dialog box where you can select a file format
 and enter the target filename.
 If the selected file format is an image format (.bmp, .tiff, etc.), the target
 filename will be the file template from which the actual filenames will
 be generated.
 Each frame will be stored in a separate file, where the frame number is
 appended to the file template.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you have selected a target file, you are ready for recording.
 Note that the capture frame will now be locked, so you can no longer move
 or resize it.
 If it is visible, it will turn red.
 The recording will begin in a paused state, allowing you to make some changes
 to the GV before recording begins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Start 
\emph default
from the menu or press the corresponding shortcut.
 Now, all the action in the GV will be recorded to the target file.
 For example, if you press the play button, the GV will loop over all timesteps
 and each step will be recorded to the file.
 You can also rotate the GV and this will also be recorded to the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To pause the recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Pause 
\emph default
from the menu.
 To finally stop the recording, select 
\emph on
Record/Stop 
\emph default
from the menu.
 This will close the target file and unlock the capture frame.

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter the different post-processing tools are discussed that PostView
 offers to display the model's data.
 The user can define a displacement map that PostView will use to deform
 the model.
 The user can also define a colormap that defines the color of the different
 parts of the model according to the corresponding element or nodal value.
 The user can also add different types of plots to display data.
 Plane cuts can be made to conveniently hide parts of the model and to inspect
 the interior of the model.

\emph default
item in the Model Viewer, the user can edit the properties of the Model.
 The following properties are defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Element subdivisions: 
\emph default
defines the number of subdivision levels.
 PostView subdivides the elements in the model to improve the quality of
 the renderings.
 However, increasing the number of subdivisions will also increase the time
 it takes to render the model so use this property judiciously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Render smooth -
\emph default
 when selected 
\emph on
yes
\emph default
, PostView will render the model smoothly.
 This means that it will vary the surface normal of the model to create
 a smooth surface.
 When selected 
\emph on
no
\emph default
, flat shading is used to render the model.
 Note that smooth shading can be significantly slower than flat shading
 due to the additional calculations that PostView needs to do.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shells as hexes -
\emph default
 renders all shells as hexahedral elements using the shell thickness (if
 available) to extrude the shell surface in the normal direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Shell reference surface -
\emph default
 defines how PostView needs to interpret the shell surface in relation to
 the shell volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Smoothing angle -
\emph default
 identifies the hard edges in the model.
 Edges with adjoining faces that have a surface normal, whose angle is more
 than the smoothing angle, are considered hard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Displacement Map
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:displacement"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PostView uses the displacement map to define the deformation of the model
 at each state.
 The displacement map can be accessed in the Model Viewer by selecting the
 item entitled 
\emph on
displacement map
\emph default
 (this is a sub-item of the 
\emph on
model 
\emph default
item).

is the data field that PostView will use to calculate the model's deformation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Scale Factor: 
\emph default
sets the displacement scale factor, which can be used to scale the displacements
 when displaying the model in the Graphics View.
 (This scale factor does affect strain measures.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you must enable the displacement map by clicking on the 
\emph on
enable 
\emph default
button in the Model Viewer (this is the button with the checkmark).
 Similarly, by clicking the button again the displacement map can be deactivated
 in which case PostView will not deform the model when displaying the different

\emph default
.
 The properties will then be listed in the Properties Window below.
 The following properties are defined for the color map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Data field - 
\emph default
allows the user to select the data field that PostView will use to define
 the color of the model.
 The color of the model is defined by the data field and the color gradient
 (see below).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Gradient smoothing -
\emph default
 PostView colors the material by drawing a fringe plot of the selected data
 field.
 When gradient smoothing is on, the fringe colors are smoothed to produce
 a continuous transition between fringes.
 When this option is off, a discrete set of colors is used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Color map: 
\emph default
defines the color map that PostView will use to color the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Nodal values -
\emph default
 PostView defines nodal data and element data.
 When displaying element data, PostView will first project the element data
 to the nodes to produce a smooth rendering of the data.
 However, when this option is turned of, element data will be displayed
 by using a single color for each element.
 This will produce a discretized drawing of the data, but will be truer
 to the actual data since the element data is not interpolated before displaying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Range type -
\emph default
 PostView keeps track of the range of the selected data field (that is the
 minimum and maximum values).
 The user can use this option to select a

 it is the line integral, for faces it is the surface integral of the selected
 surface, and for elements it is the volume integral over the volume of
 the selected elements.
